This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a dependency array that includes a function.  If the function is recreated on every render, the `useEffect` hook will run on every render, even if the dependencies haven't changed, leading to unexpected behavior or performance issues. This often manifests as an infinite loop or other strange side effects.  Example:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const myFunction = () => {
    console.log('My function is running');
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    myFunction();
  }, [myFunction]); // Incorrect dependency

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
